Example to use i2s to drive a led display
=========================================

This is example code to drive one of the common 64x32-pixel RGB LED
screen. It illustrates the parallel output mode of the I2S peripheral.

See main/app_main.c for more information and how to hook up a display.

This is PRELIMINARY CODE and Espressif gives no support on it.
